# Why ? 

KASH is learning how to work together using a git work flow. Our goals was to make a portfolio so that we could get used to git and how to solve merge conflicts etc. 

# What ?

This is our group portfolio website. We tried to answer the brief but we ran out of time. 

# How ?

We had a lot of trouble remebering to create new git branches, our team worked well together and managed to (hopefully) learn how to work with git. We feel like we could've reached our goals with the website if we had started the project today, which means that we learnt stuff. 

We tried to make the website accessible with semantic html and labels but we had trouble getting our colour scheme work with enough contrast. 

Also, we were trying to incorporate grids but we ran out of time getting it to work properly.
